  **Birth Announcement For Those Who Will And Will Never Be**, 2017 Naturally Dyed Silk, Antique Cotton batting, Cotton/Polyester Thread

  **Dye Materials**
  Catnip
  Cinnamon
  Goldenrod
  Iron (Derived from slave shackles)
  Rue
  Safflower
  Tansy

  **Birth Announcement**…draws on the historic tradition of improvisational protection
  quilts created by those in bondage during the transatlantic slave trade. The piece
  makes use of cotton batting from the mid 1800’s and incorporates botanical dyes
  made from naturally occurring abortifacients or plants historically used to induce
  miscarriage. My goal with this work is to explore the social, historical, and political
  significance of the female body, procreation, choice and all the emotional complexities
  therein.

  There are many contributing factors to this piece, being a 34 yr. old cis-gendered
  Black female whose ovaries are on the wane, I’ve been told a lot about myself and my
  body. Particularly in the current political climate, all women’s needs continue to be
  usurped by a system designed to discount and destroy us. I was prompted to begin
  relearning some of my radical wombynist teachings post election. I’ve been reminded
  viscerally by bell hook, Alice Walker, Monica Sjöö, Barbara Mor, and Anne Hibner
  Koblitz, among others, that we gave birth to the world nobody has landed on this
  earth who hasn’t passed through a womb. The creator is named as a man but creation
  lays solely in the hands wombyn.

  As all of these writers point out that Wombyn has been silenced through out history,
  her/their voice and story stifled in favor of purity and religious fidelity that governs us
  in free or bonded societies. Abortion and contraception have been in a wombyn’s
  control for thousands of years. As Anne Hibner Koblitz discusses in Sex and Herb
  and Birth Control: Women Fertility Regulation Through the Ages early agrarian
  wombyn learned from their animal counterparts about which plants induced
  miscarriage. Over time our ancestors developed a very keen sense of the wombyn’s
  body in relation to the natural world, using herbs, teas, and tinctures to control the
  flow of the world’s population. Patriarchy has responded by mentally, physically, and
  spiritually controlling The Wombyn. Our path out of bondage is learning all we can
  about our bodies, our stories, and our ancestral knowledge.
